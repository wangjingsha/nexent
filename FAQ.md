This FAQ addresses common questions and issues you might encounter while installing and deploying Nexent. For the basic installation steps, please refer to the [Quick Start Guide](../README.md#-have-a-try-first) in our README.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 🔑 Jina API Key
- **Q: How do I get a Jina API key for embeddings?**
  - A: To use Jina-based embedding model, you'll need to:
    1. Visit [Jina AI's website](https://jina.ai/), no need to sign up
    2. Navigate to the Embedding section to get your API key
    3. Add your API key in the app

### ⚙️ MCP Server Configuration
- **Q: How do I configure the MCP server? Is frontend configuration supported?**
  - A: Currently, the MCP server does not support frontend configuration. We plan to add frontend configuration in version v1.1.0. To configure the MCP server, please follow the installation and deployment steps in @README.md. After running `cp .env.example .env`, manually edit the `MCP_SERVICE` field in your `.env` file to the desired MCP service address. Save the file, and you will be able to access the corresponding MCP tools. Note: After making changes, you need to rerun deploy.sh to redeploy.

## 🚫 Common Errors & Operations

### 🌐 Port Conflicts
- **Q: Port 3000 is already in use. How can I change it?**
  - A: You can modify the port in the Docker Compose configuration file.

### 📦 Container Issues
- **Q: How do I check container logs?**
  - A: Use `docker logs <container_name>` to view logs for specific containers.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### 🔢 Embedding Model Issues

- **Q: Why can't my Embedding model connect?**
  - A: When creating a custom model and filling in the model URL, make sure to add the `/v1/embeddings` suffix. For example: `https://model.provider.com/v1/embeddings`

### 📧 Email Tools Configuration
- **Q: How can I enable and configure email tools?**
  - A: Our team has pre-implemented email tools based on IMAP and SMTP. To enable them:
    1. Configure email parameters in `.env` file
    2. Uncomment the email tool imports and registrations in `agent_utils.py`
    3. Switch to the email-enabled system prompt by using `code_agent_with_email.yaml`
    4. Restart the MCP service to apply changes
