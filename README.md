Nexent is an open-source agent platform that turns process-level natural language into complete multimodal agents — no diagrams, no wiring. Built on the MCP tool ecosystem, Nexent provides model integration, data processing, knowledge-base management, and zero-code agent development. Our goal is simple: to bring data, models, and tools together in one smart hub, making daily workflows smarter and more connected.

> One prompt. Endless reach.

### 1. 📋 Prerequisites  

| Resource | Minimum |
|----------|---------|
| **CPU**  | 2 cores |
| **RAM**  | 6 GiB   |
| **Software** | Docker & Docker Compose installed |

### 2. 🛠️ Quick start with Docker Compose

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ModelEngine-Group/nexent.git
cd nexent/docker
cp .env.example .env # fill only necessary configs
bash deploy.sh

# 创建管理员
docker exec -ti nexent bash -c 'curl -X POST http://kong:8000/auth/v1/admin/users -H "apikey: ${SERVICE_ROLE_KEY}" -H "Authorization: Bearer ${SERVICE_ROLE_KEY}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"email\":\"admin@example.com\",\"password\": \"123123\",\"role\": \"admin\",\"email_confirm\":true}"'
```

When the containers are running, open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser and follow the setup wizard.

### 3. 🤖 Model Configuration & Provider Recommendations

We recommend the following model providers:

| Model Type | Provider | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------|
| LLM & VLLM | [Silicon Flow](https://siliconflow.cn/) | Free tier available |
| LLM & VLLM | [Alibaba Bailian](https://bailian.console.aliyun.com/) | Free tier available |
| Embedding | [Jina](https://jina.ai/) | Free tier available |
| TTS & STT | [Volcengine Voice](https://www.volcengine.com/product/voice-tech) | Free for personal use |
| Search | [EXA](https://exa.ai/) | Free tier available |

You'll need to input the following information in the model configuration page:
- Base URL
- API Key
- Model Name

The following configurations need to be added to your `.env` file (we'll make these configurable through the frontend soon):
- TTS and STT related configurations
- EXA search API Key

> ℹ️ Due to core features development, currently, we only support Jina Embedding model. Support for other models will be added in future releases. For Jina API key setup, please refer to our [FAQ](FAQ.md).

## ✨ Key Features

`1` **Smart agent prompt generation**  
   Turn plain language into runnable prompts. Nexent automatically chooses the right tools and plans the best action path for every request.

   ![Feature 1](./assets/Feature1.png)

`2` **Scalable data process engine**  
   Process 20+ data formats with fast OCR and table structure extraction, scaling smoothly from a single process to large-batch pipelines.

   ![Feature 2](./assets/Feature2.png)

`3` **Personal-grade knowledge base**  
   Import files in real time, auto-summarise them, and let agents access both personal and global knowledge instantly, also knowing what it can get from each knowledge base.

   ![Feature 3](./assets/Feature3.png)

`4` **Internet knowledge search**  
   Connect to 5+ web search providers so agents can mix fresh internet facts with your private data.

   ![Feature 4](./assets/Feature4.png)

`5` **Knowledge-level traceability**  
   Serve answers with precise citations from web and knowledge-base sources, making every fact verifiable.

   ![Feature 5](./assets/Feature5.png)

`6` **Multimodal understanding & dialogue**  
   Speak, type, files, or show images. Nexent understands voice, text, and pictures, and can even generate new images on demand.

   ![Feature 6](./assets/Feature6.png)

`7` **MCP tool ecosystem**  
   Drop in or build Python plug-ins that follow the MCP spec; swap models, tools, and chains without touching core code.

# 🐛 Known Issues

1. 🔄 **Knowledge Base Refresh Delays**  
   We are aware that the knowledge base refresh mechanism currently has some delays. We plan to refactor this part soon, but please note that this is only a task management logic issue - the actual data processing speed is not affected.

2. 🤖 **Limited Model Provider Support**  
   We currently have limited support for different model providers, including voice and multimodal models. We will be rapidly updating this support in the coming weeks - stay tuned for updates!

3. 📦 **Large Docker Image Size**  
   We are aware that our current Docker image is quite large (around 10GB) as it includes a powerful, extensible data processing engine, algorithms, and models. We will soon release a Lite version to reduce the image size and make deployment faster and lighter.
