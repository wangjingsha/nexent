Nexent is an open-source agent SDK and platform that turns a single prompt into a complete multimodal service — no diagrams, no wiring. Built on MCP tool ecosystem, Nexent provides flexible model integration, scalable data processing, and robust knowledge-base management. Our goal is simple: to bring data, models, and tools together in one smart hub, so anyone can easily integrate Nexent into projects and make daily workflows smarter and more connected.

> One prompt. Endless reach.

## ✨ Key Features

`1` **Smart agent prompt generation()**  
   Turn plain language into runnable prompts. Nexent automatically chooses the right tools and plans the best action path for every request.

`2` **Scalable data process engine**  
   Process 20+ data formats with fast OCR and table structure extraction, scaling smoothly from a single process to large-batch pipelines.

   ![Feature 2](./assets/Feature2.png)

`3` **Personal-grade knowledge base**  
   Import files in real time, auto-summarise them, and let agents access both personal and global knowledge instantly, also knowing what it can get from each knowledge base.

   ![Feature 3](./assets/Feature3.png)

`4` **Internet knowledge search**  
   Connect to 5+ web search providers so agents can mix fresh internet facts with your private data.

   ![Feature 4](./assets/Feature4.png)

`5` **Knowledge-level traceability**  
   Serve answers with precise citations from web and knowledge-base sources, making every fact verifiable.

   ![Feature 5](./assets/Feature5.png)

`6` **Multimodal understanding & dialogue**  
   Speak, type, files, or show images. Nexent understands voice, text, and pictures, and can even generate new images on demand.

   ![Feature 6](./assets/Feature6.png)

`7` **MCP tool ecosystem**  
   Drop in or build Python plug-ins that follow the MCP spec; swap models, tools, and chains without touching core code.

# 🐛 Known Issues

1. 🔄 **Knowledge Base Refresh Delays**  
   We are aware that the knowledge base refresh mechanism currently has some delays, occasional errors, or instances where refreshes don't take effect. We plan to refactor this part soon, but please note that this is only a task management logic issue - the actual data processing speed is not affected.

2. 🤖 **Limited Model Provider Support**  
   We currently have limited support for different model providers, including voice and multimodal models. We will be rapidly updating this support in the coming weeks - stay tuned for updates!
