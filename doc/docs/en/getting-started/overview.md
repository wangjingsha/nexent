# Nexent

Nexent is a zero-code platform for auto-generating agents — no orchestration, no complex drag-and-drop required, using pure language to develop any agent you want. Built on the MCP ecosystem with rich tool integration, Nexent also provides various built-in agents to meet your intelligent service needs in different scenarios such as work, travel, and daily life. Nexent offers powerful capabilities for agent running control, multi-agent collaboration, data processing and knowledge tracing, multimodal dialogue, and batch scaling.
