first time doing open source, nexent is pretty cool! natural language to create agents, way easier than i thought

Moving from LangChain to the MCP ecosystem was definitely the right choice. Nexent's MCP tool integration makes our team's workflow much more standardized, especially when handling enterprise applications. The "USB-C of AI" analogy is so apt! Now our agents can seamlessly connect to various external services - no more headaches over different API formats.

moved from langchain to MCP, good choice. the "USB-C of AI" analogy is spot on

International student here! Started contributing to Nexent as part of my open source class assignment, but ended up loving the project. The documentation is so well-written that even non-native English speakers like me can easily understand and contribute. I helped translate some docs and built a study group coordination agent for our international student community. The multimodal support works great for students who prefer different communication styles!
