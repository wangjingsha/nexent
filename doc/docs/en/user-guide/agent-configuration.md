Nexent allows you to quickly use third-party MCP tools to enrich agent capabilities.

Many third-party services such as ModelScope provide MCP services, which you can quickly integrate and use.

### Custom Tools

You can refer to the following guides to develop your own tools and integrate them into Nexent to enrich agent capabilities:
- [LangChain Tools Guide](../backend/tools/langchain)
- [MCP Tool Development](../backend/tools/mcp)
- [SDK Tool Documentation](../sdk/core/tools)

## üìù Describe Business Logic

### Describe How should this Agent Work

Based on the selected collaborative agents and tools, you can now use concise language to describe how you want this agent to work. Nexent will automatically generate the agent‚Äôs name, description, and prompt suggestions based on your configuration and description.

1. In the "Describe should this agent work" editor, enter a brief description
2. Click "Generate"; Nexent will generate detailed agent content for you
3. You can further edit the generated content for fine-tuning

</div>

### Debug Agent

After completing the initial agent configuration, you can debug the agent and optimize its configuration based on the results to continuously improve agent performance.

1. In the lower right corner of the page, click the "Debug" button to open the agent debug page
2. Test conversations with the agent and observe its responses and behavior
3. Review conversation performance and error messages, and optimize the agent configuration based on the results

### Manage Agents

- **Save:** After successful debugging, click the "Save" button in the lower right corner to save the agent. The agent will then be available for selection in the chat page.
- **Export:** Export the successfully debugged agent configuration as a JSON file. When creating an agent, you can use this JSON file to create a copy via import.
- **Delete:** Delete the agent (use with caution)
